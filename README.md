# Tenant-Scripts
PowerShell Scripts for various functions in a Microsoft Tenant.

Some of these are my inventions(20%) and most of these are taken 
from various other clever people's sites and blogs(80%) and then 
modified to suite my purpose.

My inspirations are mentioned below.

Anybody else who is thinking of sueing me for copyright, 
I acknowledge that you came with the idea first and i just read your mind afterwards (one acquires that skill after staying married to one+self for a long time)
Just let me know please and i will add your name to the list above.
